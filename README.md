A simple application to open both ms & qp papers together quickly!. Just enter the paper code and that's it! You can choose to either download or view the papers.
Works on all Windows platforms. It's under 6KB!

This program relies on the Dynamic Papers website.

Since this is a ".bat" file, your browser and Windows will automatically show a warning. You can safely ignore it.
